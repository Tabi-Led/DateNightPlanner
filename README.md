dual server side api 
Product description- A web application that decides your date night in for you. The user can input the type of movie and food that they are interested in. The web application will then pull a recipe and movie for them. 



Users:
Everyone. Everyone needs to eat and be entertained. Times are tough, people are busy. This will take quite a bit of thinking off everyone’s plate. 
The problem it will take on will be:
What to make for dinner?
What to watch?

User story- AS a couple, I WANT an application to take the guess work out of what to eat and what movie to watch.
SO THAT I can have a quality dinner and movie selection ready to save time.
